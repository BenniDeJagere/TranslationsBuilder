# Translations Builder

Translations Builder is a custom application created with .NET and C#
which can be deployed as an external tool for Power BI Desktop to assist
with the creation and management of dataset translations. which can be
used to build multi-language reports which target the Power BI Service.
This document assumes the reader already understands the fundamentals of
Power BI features for localization. For readers without this background,
it is recommended to read and understand

The Translations Builder application can be used AS IS in a USER CONTEXT
by builders who are creating datasets and report using Power BI Desktop.
You can read through the **Users Guide** to learn to understand the

The Translations Builder application can be used in a DEVELOPER CONTEXT
by professional development teams who are creating datasets and report
using Power BI Desktop. You can read through the DEVELOPERS GUIDE.

Power BI provides Internationalization and localization features which
make it possible to build multi-language reports. For example, you can
design a Power BI report that renders in English for some users while
rendering in Spanish, French, German or Dutch for other users. If a
company or organization has the requirement of building Power BI reports
that support multiple languages, it's no longer necessary to clone and
maintain a separate PBIX project file for each language. Instead, they
can increase reuse and lower report maintenance by designing and
implementing multi-language reports.
