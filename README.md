# Translations Builder

Power BI as a platform provides effective features for
Internationalization and localization making it possible to build
multi-language reports. For example, you can design a Power BI report
that renders in English for some users while rendering in Spanish,
French, German or Dutch for other users. If an organization has the
requirement of building Power BI reports that support multiple
languages, it's no longer necessary to clone and maintain a separate
PBIX project file for each language. Instead, the organization can
increase reuse and lower report maintenance by designing and
implementing multi-language reports.

Translations Builder is an external tool created for Power BI Desktop
specifically to assist report authors and dataset authors with tasks
associated with creating translations and building multi-language
reports. **As a user**, you can install Translations Builder and use it
together with Power BI Desktop to build and test datasets and reports
that support multiple languages. **As a developer**, you can clone the
GitHub repository with the Translations Builder source code and extend
this application to meet whatever translation and localization
requirements your organization faces.

To begin using Translations Builder as a user, start by walking through
the [**Installation
Guide**](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/TranslationsBuilder/blob/main/Docs/Installation%20Guide.md)
to ensure you get Translations Builder up and running on the Windows PC
where you have installed Power BI Desktop. After you get the tool
installed, it is recommended to work through the Hands-on Lab so you can
quick understand the end-to-end process of creating translations in
Power BI Desktop and then testing them in the Power BI Service. You
should also review the [**User
Guide**](https://github.com/PowerBiDevCamp/TranslationsBuilder/blob/main/Docs/User%20Guide.md)
which walks you through basic operations as well as advanced procedures.
